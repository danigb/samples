Ergo electric upright bass played and mapped by D. Smolken.
There is one SFZ file for arco (bowed) notes and one for pizz (plucked) notes. There is a bonus folder of kicks - parts of the lowest notes processed into sounds that could be used in the place of kick drums.
Fifths tuning (CGDA) though the low C string was also sampled tuned down to A and E. That makes the lowest E samples an octave below a standard four string bass.
Thomastik-Infeld Spirocore strings, F.G. Pfretzschner bow, Pops' rosin. All samples recorded direct.
