1958 Otto Rubner double bass played and mapped by D. Smolken.
Arco and pizzicato with SFZ mappings, miscellaneous noises also included with each file.
There is one file for arco, one for pizz, and one with key switches for everything.
The extras folder under the arco samples contains some samples made by layering some of the arco Cs.
Those extra samples are not mapped to anything, they're just extra - try resynthesizing them in Harmor.
Fifths tuning (CGDA), Thomastik-Infeld Spirocore strings. F.G. Pfretzchner bow, Pops' rosin.
