Meatbass is a sample library for Plogue Sforzando version 1.845 or newer. It contains samples of a 1958 Otto Rubner double bass played and mapped by Drogomir Smolken, recorded by Ludwik Zamenhof.

Fifths tuning (CGDA), Thomastik-Infeld Spirocore strings. F.G. Pfretzschner bow, Pops' rosin.

This instrument is open source, and you can do whatever you want with it; however, the XML bank contains a digital signature, and editing the XML bank will break the ability of Plogue Sforzando to load the instrument with the GUI.

To register the Sforzando bank, drag the Meatbass.bank.xml file onto the Sforzando interface. Once registered, the instrument will be available in the Sforzando loading menu and the GUI will work.

The instruments are:
Arco (mod wheel) - sustained bowing with two round robins, dynamics and tone color controlled by mod wheel
Arco (3 velocity layers) - sustained bowing with three velocity layers and two round robins
Arco (5 velocity layers) - bowing with five velocity layers and two round robins, generally sustained though the notes in the top two layers are not very long, no looping for infinite sustain
Pizzicato - plucked notes with four velocity layers and four round robins, percussive noises with round robins also included above the notes

The detune and width controls only affect the sound when 3 or 6 voices are selected. The glide control affects glide time when one of the monophonic mappings is selected - it has no effect on the poly mappings.
