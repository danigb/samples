SFZ mappings and WAV files. Requires Plogue Sforzando version 1.809 or newer for all the controls to function, but the basic one-voice mappings should be usable with any SFZ-compatible sampler. Free download, open source and royalty-free for all commercial and non-commercial use, including conversion into other sampler formats and redistribution as part of larger sample libraries.

spaghetti - roundwound strings
linguine - flatwound strings, picked, bridge pickup
tagliatelle - flatwound strings, picked, muted, pickup combo
fetuccine - flatwound strings, fingered, neck pickup

The originally released version was supposed to have 24-bit WAV files but was actually a mix of 32 and 24, which is not a good idea. So here everything's converted to 16 bits.
