Sample library of a Squier Jazz Bass played by a bassist with very good hair, edited and mapped by a bassist with a shaved head.

The included SFZ mappings are:
Dirty: sustained notes with release samples - the basic mapping
Clean: sustained notes with no release samples
Vicious: staccato notes
Angry: sustained and staccato notes at once, plus release samples
Weird: just the release samples, triggered on key attack instead of release
Excessive: all sustained and staccato round robins at once spread in stereo for a total of nine voices
Shifty: three voices spread in stereo, with two of them created by shifting higher samples down

Regular EADG tuning, though the low E string was also sampled tuned down to C#. The strings are roundwounds, about six months old. All samples recorded direct, using both pickups and all knobs on 10.

Sustained notes have four velocity layers and four round robins, staccato notes and release samples have five round robins, and pick scrapes have four round robins.
