1977 Rhodes Mark I Stage 73, shorter looped samples

16 Mb disk space

## jRhodes3 family

jRhodes3 is my sampling of my 1977 Rhodes Mark I Stage 73 electric piano, which
I purchased new back in 1978. This sample set is not intended to be a jack-of-all-trades
Rhodes, but rather, it's how I usually set up and used my Rhodes. It was recorded with EQ,
with a treble boost and low-mid scoop, emphasizing the bell tones, and with
substantial bark on the higher velocity layers. There are 5 layers, sampled
to peak at 3dB difference per layer at on the low notes and to maintain volume
throughout each layer. Not all layers are full-keyboard width, as higher notes
don't change timbre as much.

The set includes 67 16-bit looped samples, with up to 5 velocity layers,
sampling every 4th white key.
The samples were recorded directly from the harp connector.
Samples are encoded in lossless FLAC format to reduce disk space.

## This version: jRhodes3c

jRhodes3**c** is a looped version, with stereo option.  Samples are looped after a
few seconds, to save memory and disk space.

The stereo effect is a mild pitch-shift doubling to create a stereo image, applied in mid-side effect so that it cancels out when summed to mono.

Three .szf files are included:
* jRhodes3c-looped-both.sfz - mono is MIDI Program 1, stereo is MIDI program 2
* jRhodes3c-looped-mono.sfz - mono only
* jRhodes3c-looped-stereo.sfz - stereo only

## How-to

Click the green "Code" button above, and choose "Download ZIP". Unpack the .zip
file into a folder of your choice, and load the result into your sample player.  I use Sforzando,
which supports FLAC.  You only need the jRhodes3c-flac-sfz folder and its contents.
The .sfz file in there is what you load into your player.

## Sampling Details

The samples were recorded around 2006, from a Rhodes I had bought
new in 1978.  The samples were recorded directly from the harp
connector, with EQ applied to give the tone I usually used, enhancing
the bell-like quality and carving out low mids.  The stereo samples have
a stereo image added to by applying a 2 cent pitch shift using mid-side
technique (so the effect cancels completely when summed to mono).
Noise was removed from the samples using CoolEdit 96.

Samples in this set were looped to reduce memory footprint.
For full-length unlooped samples, see jRhodes3d.

This is not intended to be the authentic original unprocessed Rhodes;
it's intended to be what I wanted the Rhodes to sound like most of
the time.

Regarding the naming convention: the 3 is because this was my
third sampling attempt.  (The first was a single-velocity sampling
for dev test purposes only.  The second was aborted for technical
reasons I don't recall.)  The "c" identifies this as the 3rd
attempt at processing the samples or mapping the keyboard.

The "d" mono samples are identical to the "c" samples but full-length.
The "d" stereo samples have the same effect applied as "c" but
using different tools (SoX library rather than r8brain.)

I lost the original sample recordings in a home fire, but fortunately
I did have distribution copies of the original looped and unlooped
soundfont files, and these sample sets are recreated from them.
